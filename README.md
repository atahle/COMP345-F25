## Project Overview
This repository contains our **semester-long team project** for COMP 345.  
The project is divided into **three assignments**, each building on the previous one, to gradually develop a playable **Risk-style game engine** based on the rules of [Warzone](https://www.warzone.com/).

- **Assignment 1:** Core architecture (Map, Player, Orders, Cards, Game Engine).  
- **Assignment 2:** Reinforcement rules, battle simulation, order execution logic.  
- **Assignment 3:** Full game flow with advanced features and final polish.  

The end goal is a complete **command-line playable Warzone game**.

## Game Description
- The **map** is a connected graph: nodes = territories, edges = adjacency.  
- **Continents** are connected subgraphs with control bonuses.  
- **Players** own territories and armies, issue orders, and attempt to conquer the map.  
- The **main loop** follows Warzoneâ€™s phases:  
  1. **Startup** â†’ assign players & territories.  
  2. **Reinforcement** â†’ armies allocated.  
  3. **Orders Issuing** â†’ players declare moves.  
  4. **Orders Execution** â†’ battles resolved, territories conquered.  
  5. **End** â†’ winner declared.
